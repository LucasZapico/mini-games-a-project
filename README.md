A simple letter scramble app moving onto the world wide web from its humble origins as [reorder-string - codepen](https://codepen.io/LucasZapico/pen/wvMqqwO) project.

## About: TL:DR

The original [reorder-string - codepen](https://codepen.io/LucasZapico/pen/wvMqqwO) was meant as both a practice project in vanillajs and to solve my lack of ability to come up with "good" usernames.

To solve this conundrum I came up with the \*brilliant notion to just randomize my name. Not a perfect solution but one that is a good enough so I can put my brain onto other things.

### General Thoughts

I decided to build this with Nextjs-TypeScript and styled with [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) to practice working with Typescript and because building and deploying with Nextjs is so seamless.

This very much can be considered overkill but the out of the box Nextj pipelines are too appealing even for a little project like this.

<!-- I might go back and make the same app in Vanillajs just to compare and contrast the process. üò© For the Reddit purist out their that feel this is a chainsaw to cut butter.  -->
